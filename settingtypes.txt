# The interval at which environmental particles will generate, every X seconds. A smaller interval will trigger particles more often but will use more system resources and vice-versa.

# The percentage chance of environmental particles to generate per node every interval. Lower numbers generate fewer particles and vice-versa.

# The x radius around each player in which effervescent nodes are checked for at each interval.

# The z radius around each player in which effervescent nodes are checked for at each interval.
effervescence.environmental.radius_z (Search radius z) int 16 8 32

# The number of nodes to shift a player's search box for effervescent nodes in the environment based on the direction they're looking. This causes more particles to spawn in the direction a player is looking which creates more particles in view at the expense of fewer particles further away in the opposite direction. This number is halved for the y axis.
